## Overview

The primary purpose of this project is to streamline data processing using an ETL pipeline. This pipeline automates the following tasks:
- **Extracting** data from external sources.
- **Transforming** the extracted data to meet specific analytical or business needs.
- **Loading** the transformed data into a PostgreSQL database for easy analysis and further data processing.

This project leverages **Docker** for containerization to simplify deployment and ensure consistency across different environments.
